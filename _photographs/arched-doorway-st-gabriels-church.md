The remains of this chapel sits below the Golden Cap hill near to Charmouth in Dorset. The walls and doorways are preserved but no roof remains. I took this photograph and made some refinements to bring out the texture of the stone.

This belongs to a growing photographic collection of arches  (windows,doorways and roof details ) that you can see below.
