The Norman castle in this Sussex town boasts a captivating archway fashioned from sandstones of many hues — soft reds, warm yellows, and muted browns. Centuries of weathering have roughened the stone surfaces, giving the arch a rugged, beauty that stands out against the flint walls.

The first arch rises in a graceful, pointed _lancet_ style, while the second curves more gently in a simple, rounded form.
