Summer 2025 and the stay in Greece is over. Time to get back to England.
I took this photo on the flight from Corfu to London, Heathrow. We can just make out the coast of Belgium.

Soon after this photo was taken the seatbelt sign was switched on and we began our descent. We flew along the Thames estuary for some time giving window seat occupiers a good view of the London River.
