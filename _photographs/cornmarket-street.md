If you are in Oxford and fancy a coffee in Pret a Manger in Cornmarket Street, you will find yourself in an ancient building that dates from the 14th Century. Look around you and you will see the well preserved timbers and stone work.

Originally, this building was an Inn and may have had a courtyard. Fortunately, the building was extensively restored in the 1980s and now belongs to Jesus College.
