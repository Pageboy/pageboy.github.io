I came across this section of wall on Walton Street in Oxford, likely forming part of the boundary to Worcester College, whose main entrance is on Beaumont Street.

The wall has a wonderfully rich texture, shaped by a long history of repairs—patches of concrete, weathered sandstone, and occasional pieces of dressed stone. There are also some intriguing narrow inserts that appear to be fragments of tile.

Lichen is present across some of the the surface as well, which is hardly surprising given the dampness of Oxford’s winter streets.
