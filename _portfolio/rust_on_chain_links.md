Corrosion seems like a negative thing; wasting away and dirty. But, actually no; rusted metal is rich in colour and texture and in this image I use some images of rusted chains that I have taken in sea locations.

These images form the inspiration for the colours that I use in this structure. You will see squares, hexagons and triangles as well as a rhomboid shape.

* Dockside salt spray
* Rusted chains
* Links and shackles
