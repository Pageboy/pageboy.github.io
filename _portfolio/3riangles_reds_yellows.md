In a restaurant one evening a bowl of tomatoes on the counter caught my eye and I used this photo together with others that I have taken of berries and other tomatoes to make this geometric collage.

I am using a hexagon (6 sided symmetrical figure) to arrange 3 triangles.

* Polished Reds
* Juice Filled Bursting
* Yellow Berries Shine like the Sun
