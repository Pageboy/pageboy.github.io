Autumn is the season of fireworks—much to the dismay of our pets—and the leaves of this tree seem to echo the colours of the flames rising from bonfires across the country.

In a village garden, the leaves of a Sumac Staghorn tree spill over the wall, their vivid red foliage immediately drawing the eye.

Though grown ornamentally here, the Sumac tree originates from Western Asia. Its dried berries are used as a herb, adding a bright, salty, lemony flavour to many dishes.
