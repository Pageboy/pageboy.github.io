On the beautiful Greek island of Paxos in the Ionian Sea, *Turpentine Trees* stand among the olive groves, their branches adorned with brightly coloured berries. 

Work in progress and ready for 3 panels. Overall dimensions will be 915mm square.

>  Part of an ongoing series, this work uses three _golden rectangles_ (1:1.67 ratio) arranged to frame the photograph and echo arcs of color found within the image.
> 
> The work is currently as print on Hahnemühle paper (A3+ - 485mm x 330mm). When the time is right this will become a panel piece.
> 3 panels will be bolted together - 3 x 465mm x 350mm with an overall size of 915mm x 915mm
> Each of these rectangles is a _golden rectangle_ 
> Please view [Berberis](https://www.chrisjennings.net/portfolio/berberis/) here for an idea of how this will look full size
