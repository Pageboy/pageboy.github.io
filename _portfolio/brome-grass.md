In the meadows near the river, the blades of Smooth Brome Grass reveal surprising colours, shifting gently from one hue to another. Their subtle fusions create a soft backdrop against which the arcs of the composition emerge.

## Work in progress

>  Part of an ongoing series, this work uses three _golden rectangles_ (1:1.67 ratio) arranged to frame the photograph and echo arcs of color found within the image.
> 
> The work is currently as print on Hahnemühle paper (A3+ - 485mm x 330mm). When the time is right this will become a panel piece.
> 3 panels will be bolted together - 3 x 465mm x 350mm with an overall size of 915mm x 915mm
> Each of these rectangles is a _golden rectangle_ 
> Please view [Berberis](https://www.chrisjennings.net/portfolio/berberis/) here for an idea of how this will look full size
