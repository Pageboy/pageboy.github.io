The shoreline is a rich observational space for colours and forms.

I love the way that the tide washes over the different elements and wetness changes everything. I am inspired by the forms between the land and the sea and adding my geometry and extracting colours from the fragments is one of my endeavours.

* Wet shore pebbles shine
* Flint and sandstone sea smoothed
* Barnacles dried above the tide
