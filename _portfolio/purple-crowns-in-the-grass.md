The colour of the Summer grasses range from yellow-ochres to lush, verdant greens and forms a contrasting background to the vibrant purple-pink ragged-crowns of the knapweed that dot the field.

The greens and purples are flooded into the *golden rectangles* and a further grass image is used to fill the overlayed fragment.
