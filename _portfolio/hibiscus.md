Set against the dense greenery of a Mayan village in Mexico, hibiscus flowers emerge in vivid orange-reds and soft pinks. The camera captures the subtle blending of these colours, which are then echoed in the rectangles and curves of this piece constructed from 4 *golden* rectangles.

Part of an ongoing series, this work uses three _golden rectangles_ (1:1.67 ratio) arranged to frame the photograph and echo arcs of colour found within the image.
