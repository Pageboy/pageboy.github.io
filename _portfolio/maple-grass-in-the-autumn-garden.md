Before the great *leaf pickup* begins in our garden, the grounded maple leaves form a spectacle of colours; oranges, yellows and browns contrasting against the viridian greens of the cropped grass. As the equinox winds finally eject the reluctant leaves from the branches, grass will be hidden so we must rake them away for recycling. The sweeps and bands in the rectangles proportioned with √ 2 are filled with the colours found by the camera that points to the ground.
