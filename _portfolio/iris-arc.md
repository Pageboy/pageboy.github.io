The low arc motif draws together the contrasting hues found in this flower, relating also to the shape of the rainbow.
**Iris** was the Greek goddess of the rainbow.

For a few brief days the garden *flags* show their brilliant purples and yellows and we are grateful for the insects that are attracted to them and act as pollinators for the next generation of flowers.
