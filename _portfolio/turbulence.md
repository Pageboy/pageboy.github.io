The Thames rushes through the weir, its paddles fully open. The roar of the water feels threatening and dangerous but we are mesmerised by the whirlpools and eddies, each crest catching the winter sunlight. Amidst a blend of browns, greens, and blues, the water mirrors the sky - our geometry taking on the hues over two vertical *golden rectangles.*
