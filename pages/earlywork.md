A retrospective of my early work. This represents all the types of art work that I did until 1990. Some of this work was photographed with 35mm Ektachrome transparency film and digitized with an Epson V800 scanner (some dust may remain!).

I have tried to accurately provide dimensions and dates, but I have to say, that my record keeping was not the best.
