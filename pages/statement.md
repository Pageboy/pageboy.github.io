### Fusing nature's colours with cohesive geometries

All works are wall hung; mostly panels of a 32mm depth.

### My Creative Process

In my artistic journey, I've discovered a profound fascination with the harmonious interplay between the natural world and the structured order of geometry. My digital collages represent a creative exploration where I seamlessly blend the intricate details captured in photographs from nature with meticulously constructed geometric shapes derived from the colours within these images.

The creative process of blending photographs and geometry often requires a careful balance between spontaneity and planning. In my workflow, I  experiment with various arrangements and geometric compositions to discover what resonates most with the intended message or aesthetic. Digital tools provide the flexibility to experiment without the permanence of physical cut-and-paste methods, making it easier to refine and iterate.

### Visual Journey

My collages encapsulate the duality of creation - the vibrant spontaneity of nature and the calculated artistry of geometry. I arrange the geometric shapes, infusing them with purpose and intention. They guide the viewer's eye, leading them on a visual journey through the composition. The marriage of photographic details and geometric shapes cultivates a unique synergy that sparks curiosity and invites introspection.

### Digital Collage

In essence, my digital collages transcend the confines of traditional art forms. They embody a harmony that is both visual and philosophical, inviting viewers to contemplate the delicate equilibrium between chaos and order, the ephemeral and the enduring. Through this creative process, I hope to foster a deeper connection between humanity and the natural world, encouraging us all to appreciate the intricate beauty that surrounds us and the underlying unity that binds us together.
