Matthew Arnold (1822-88) was familiar with this view from East of the city of Oxford and his poem, *Thyrsis* included the phrase **dreaming spires.**

How changed is here each spot man makes or fills!\
In the two Hinkseys nothing keeps the same;\
The village-street its haunted mansion lacks,\
And from the sign is gone Sibylla’s name,\
And from the roofs the twisted chimney-stacks.\
Are ye too changed, ye hills?\
See, ’tis no foot of unfamiliar men\
To-night from Oxford up your pathway strays!\
Here came I often, often, in old days;\
Thyrsis and I; we still had Thyrsis then.

Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth Farm,\
Up past the wood, to where the elm-tree crowns\
The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames?\
The Signal-Elm, that looks on Ilsley Downs,\
The Vale, the three lone wears, the youthful Thames?—\
This winter-eve is warm,\
Humid the air; leafless, yet soft as spring,\
The tender purple spray on copse and briers;\
And that sweet City with her **dreaming spires**\
She needs not June for beauty’s heightening,

Lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night.

The distant view will have changed slightly and you may notice an incongruous red building that is recent addition.

I have taken a picture of this red building from the other side of the Thames at Grandpont.
