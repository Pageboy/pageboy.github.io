I'm on the bus, on my way home. It's getting dark and it's raining. I'm on the top deck at the front. I'm struggling see where we are (I'm looking for my stop). The bus is full and everyone is breathing; why shouldn't they?

## Condensation

I'm tempted to wipe my sleeve across the window, so I can see where we are, but then I don't really want to get that moisture on me.

I take a photo instead.

I'm going downstairs now and I am relieved to find this is my stop. I am also pleased to see that the driver doesn't have the _condensation_ problem at all.
