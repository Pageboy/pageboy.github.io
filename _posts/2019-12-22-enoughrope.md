It's the stuff that we use on boats to hoist our sails and to hold on to the wharf. It is an amazing material that we couldn't really do without â€“ not just in the marine environment but in construction, farming and the haulage business too. If you like climbing mountains then you depend on rope to keep you alive.

Rope is formed in many ways, single strand to multi-braided. It can be made from many materials both natural and synthetic. Some ropes may stretch others will float; some are rough on the hands but some are smooth and make good warps.
