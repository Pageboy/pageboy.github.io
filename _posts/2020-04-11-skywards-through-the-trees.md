Spending a lot of time in the garden because of the lockdown, I find myself looking skywards through the trees.

We are fortunate to have a good sized garden, but any town garden is going to feel limited by the fences that restrict our views to the wider landscape. But looking up through the trees makes us feel part of the world; the passing clouds are only ours while they are directly above - they move on for for others to view.

We have several trees but the 2 that dominate our garden are the Oak tree which is probably more than 100 years old, and a sycamore that is near by. These trees schedule their leaf **growth** and leaf **drop** at different times.

The girth (circumference) of the trunk of the tree is 3 metres near to the ground. This is a listed[^1] tree.

^1]: This means that this ancient oak is listed as a national treasure and cannot be felled or trimmed without permission.
