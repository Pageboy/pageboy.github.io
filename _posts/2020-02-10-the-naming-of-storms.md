Just today we have been suffering from the onslaught of storm *Ciara* (edit) and now storm *Dennis* has arrived. Trees are down and much debris on the pavements. The chain saws are out and the branches are being shredded.

**But why is this storm named Ciara?**

The UK, Irish and the Dutch met offices have agreed a naming system that alternates between male and female names. You can see here from this snapshot from [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_storm_naming_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_Ireland) that the names are set for 2020.

Some of these names are a little worrying. How will we feel under the storm named *Noah*? Let's hope this won't tempt fate to give us a large flood. Storm *Francis* could be male or female. Storm *Kitty* promises to give us `raining cats and dogs` I suppose.
