Diesel engines are heavy machines and cannot be lifted without some kind of pulley system. I used a chain hoist but I had to get above the engine bay somehow. I was fortunate enough to have a strng piece of 4 x 1.5in  length of pine that I was able to support on a pair of wooden triangles (bits of an old bunk bed). This constructed ganntry was enough to get the engine up onto the floor of the saloon.

Once the engine was lifted up then the floor had to put back under the swinging engine and then let back down onto a trolley.

**Why a trolley?** 

Perspectief has an offset entrance so the engine needed be shifted from the centre to the port side ready to lifted out by crane.

## Cleaning up the engine bay

The new engine is on order so now I have time to prepare the engine bay.

Here are a couple of before and after pictures. I used some bilge cleaner and bilge paint. No poit in putting a new ingine into a dirty engine bay!

Now let's see what it looks like now.

Next stage is taking delivery of the new engine and craning that in.
