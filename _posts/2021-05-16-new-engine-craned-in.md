New Betamarine engine arrived at the marina in a big cardboard box. Beautifully packaged and mounted on a wooden palet. Two control panels where taken home for safe keeping and for checking against the new dashboards that I had made.

## The Engine Bay was prepared and waiting - did I get the measurements right?

You can't fit a brand new engine into a dirty engine bay can you?

## How did I measure the engine bay and bearers?

I built a jig from wood and mounted this in the position on the bearers. Take a look at this video

### Engine was delivered and we now needed to use a crane to lift into position.

Thanks to George the crane driver, Les and Neil who also did some heavy lifting - and friends and family who came to watch.
