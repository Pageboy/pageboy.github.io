Late April and we take the train to Wargrave for a trip upstream to Oxford. The mooring at Osney awaits! Our first lock was Shiplake. Here the crew is holding on while we wait for the lock to open.

Perspectief was put back in the water at the marina and we found the boat ready for departure. We carried with us some supplies.

We needed further supplies so the Tesco shop in Reading was a convenient place to stop.

**Overnight near to Dorchester-on-Thames**

Favourite place for a nightâ€™s mooring. Time it for a walk to the top of Wittenham Clumps.

Between Sandford and Iffley we moor up on the opposite bank to Rose Island.

Rose Island was once the location for _The Swan_ pub. This close in 1929.
