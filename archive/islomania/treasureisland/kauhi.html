        was uninhabited; it was all green brush and white sand, set in transcendently 
        blue water; even the coco-palms were rare, though some of these completed 
        the bright harmony of colour by hanging out a fan of golden yellow. For 
        long there was no sign of life beyond the vegetable, and no sound but 
        the continuous grumble of the surf. In silence and desertion these fair 
        shores slipped past, and were submerged and rose again with clumps of 
        thicket from the sea. And then a bird or two appeared, hovering and crying; 
        swiftly these became more numerous, and presently, looking ahead, we were 
        aware of a vast effervescence of winged life. In this place the annular 
        isle was mostly under water, carrying here and there on its submerged 
        line a wooded islet. Over one of these the birds hung and flew with an 
        incredible density like that of gnats or hiving bees; the mass flashed 
        white and black, and heaved and quivered, and the screaming of the creatures 
        rose over the voice of the surf in a shrill clattering whirr. As you descend 
        some inland valley a not dissimilar sound announces the nearness of a 
        mill and pouring river. Some stragglers, as I said, came to meet our approach; 
        a few still hung about the ship as we departed. The crying died away, 
        the last pair of wings was left behind, and once more the low shores of 
        Kauehi streamed past our eyes in silence like a picture. I supposed at 
        the time that the birds lived, like ants or citizens, concentred where 
        we saw them. I have been told since (I know not if correctly) that the 
        whole isle, or much of it, is similarly peopled; and that the effervescence 
        at a single spot would be the mark of a boat's crew of egg-hunters from 
        one of the neighbouring inhabited atolls. So that here at Kauehi, as the 
        day before at Taiaro, the CASCO sailed by under the fire of unsuspected 
        eyes. And one thing is surely true, that even on these ribbons of land 
        an army might lie hid and no passing mariner divine its presence.</font></p>
