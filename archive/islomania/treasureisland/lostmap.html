        map was the chief part of my plot. </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For instance, I had 
        called an islet 'Skeleton Island,' not knowing what I meant, seeking only 
        for the immediate picturesque, and it was to justify this name that I 
        broke into the gallery of Mr. Poe and stole Flint's pointer. And in the 
        same way, it was because I had made two harbours that the HISPANIOLA was 
        sent on her wanderings with Israel Hands. The time came when it was decided 
        to republish, and I sent in my manuscript, and the map along with it, 
        to Messrs. Cassell. The proofs came, they were corrected, but I heard 
        nothing of the map. I wrote and asked; was told it had never been received, 
        and sat aghast. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is one thing to 
        draw a map at random, set a scale in one corner of it at a venture, and 
        write up a story to the measurements. It is quite another to have to examine 
        a whole book, make an inventory of all the allusions contained in it, 
        and with a pair of compasses, painfully design a map to suit the data. 
        I did it; and the map was drawn again in my father's office, with embellishments 
        of blowing whales and sailing ships, and my father himself brought into 
        service a knack he had of various writing, and elaborately FORGED the 
        signature of Captain Flint, and the sailing directions of Billy Bones.
