        reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of Mull, 
        off a little isle they call Earraid, which lay low and black upon the 
        larboard. Sometimes the swell broke clean over us; sometimes it only ground 
        the poor brig upon the reef, so that we could hear her beat herself to 
        pieces; and what with the great noise of the sails, and the singing of 
        the wind, and the flying of the spray in the moonlight, and the sense 
        of danger, I think my head must have been partly turned, for I could scarcely 
        understand the things I saw. ..........</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">.......The 
        time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me, that 
        I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I have read of people cast 
        away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of things 
        would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose. My case 
        was very different. I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan's silver 
        button; and being inland bred, I was as much short of knowledge as of 
        means..........</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">........A 
        sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only what 
        they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can be 
        entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod, or 
        at the most by wading. Even I, who had the tide going out and in before 
        me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get my shellfish 
        -- even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of raging at my 
        fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free.</font></p>
