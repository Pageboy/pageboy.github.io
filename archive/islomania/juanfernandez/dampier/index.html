        had lived here alone more than three Years, and although he was several 
        Times sought after by the Spaniards, who knew he was left on the Island, 
        they could never find him. He had been in the Woods hunting for Goats, 
        when Captain Watlin drew off his Men, and the Ship was under sail before 
        he came back to shore. He had with him his Gun and a Knife, with a small 
        Horn of Powder, and a few Shot. When these had been spent, he contrived 
        a Way, by notching his Knife, to saw the Barrel off his Gun into small 
        Pieces, with which he made Harpoons, Lances, Hooks and a long Knife. He 
        did this by heating the pieces first in the Fire, which he struck with 
        his Gun-flint, and a piece of the Barrel of his Gun which he hardened, 
        having learnt to do that among the English. The hot pieces of Iron he 
        would hammer out and bend as he pleased with Stones, and saw them with 
        his jagged Knife, or grind them to an edge by long labour and harden them 
        to a good Temper, as there was occasion. All this may seem strange to 
        those that are not acquainted with the Sagacity of the Indians, but it 
        is no more than these Moskito Men are accustomed to in their own Country, 
        where they make their own Fishing and Striking-Instruments without Forge 
        or Anvil, though they spend a great deal of Time about it.</font></p>

        such Instruments as he made in that manner, he got such Provision as the 
        Island afforded, either Goats or Fish. He told us that at first he was 
        forced to eat Seal, which is very ordinary Meat, before he had made Hooks. 
        But afterwards he never killed any Seals except to make Lines, cutting 
        their Skins into Thongs. He had a httle House, or Hut, half a Mile from 
        the Sea, which was lined with Goat's Skin. His Couch, or Barbecue of Sticks, 
        lay along about two feet from the Ground, and was spread with the same 
        as was all his Bedding. He had no Clothes left, having worn out those 
        he brought from Watlin's Ship, but only a Skin about his Waist. He had 
        seen our Ship the Day before we came to an Anchor, and believed we were 
        English. He therefore killed three Goats in the Morning, before we came 
        to an Anchor, and dressed them with Cabbage, to treat us when we came 
        ashore. He then came to the Seaside to congratulate our safe Arrival.</font></p>    </td>

        at Robin's feet, and was also taken up by him. We stood with pleasure 
        to behold the surprise and tenderness and solemnity of this Interview, 
        which was exceedingly affectionate on both Sides. When their Ceremonies 
        of Civility were over, we who had stood gazing at them also drew near, 
        each of us embracing the Man we had found here. He was overjoyed to see 
        so many of his old Friends come here, as he thought, purposely to fetch 
        him. He was named Will, and the other was Robin. These were names given 
        them by the English, for they had no Names among themselves. And they 
        take it as a great favour to be named by any of us, and will complain 
        for want of it, if we do not appoint them some name when they are with

      his Voyage from Lima to Baldivia, and he also discovered another Island 
      about the same bigness, 20 Leagues to the Westward of this. The Island took 
      its Name from its first Discoverer who, when he returned to Lima, desired 
      a Patent for it, designing to settle here. It was on his second Voyage here 
      that he set ashore three or four Goats, which have since, by their increase, 
      well stocked the whole Island. But he could never get a Patent for it, which 
      is why it still lies destitute of Inhabitants, though doubtless capable 
      of maintaining 4 or 500 Families by what may be produced off the Land only. 
      I speak much within compass, for the Savannahs would at present feed 1000 
      Head of Cattle, besides Goats, and the Land being cultivated would probably 
      bear Corn or Wheat, and good Peas, Yams, or Potatoes, for the Land in the 
      Valleys and sides of the Mountains is of a good black fruitful Mould.</font></td>
