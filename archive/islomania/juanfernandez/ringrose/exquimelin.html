      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">This book 
        was first published in Dutch at Amsterdam in 1678 as De Americaenche Zee-Roovers. 
        The English version was translated from the Spanish version in 1684. the 
        authors name was anglicized to that of John Esquemeling. Born a Frenchman, 
        most probably a native of Harfleur in Normandy, Exquemelin came to the 
        new world as a indentured servant for the French West India Company in 
        1666. For three years he served on the island of Tortuga, a haven for 
        buccaneers at the time. He then joined the buccaneers, possibly as a barber-surgeon. 
        Alexander Exquemelin accompanied Henry Morgan, a legendary figure of piracy 
        who later became the governor of Jamaica, on most of his expeditions.
