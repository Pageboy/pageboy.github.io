        Island of <b>Juan Fernandez</b> was visited by Captain Joshua Slocum in 
        1896 during his lone voyage in the <i>Spray</i>:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">..... Juan 
        Fernandez, as a place of call, is a lovely spot. The hills are well wooded, 
        the valleys fertile, and pouring down through many ravines are streams 
        of pure water. There are no serpents on the island, and no wild beasts 
        other than pigs and goats, of which I saw a number, with possibly a dog 
        or two. The people lived without the use of rum or beer of any sort. There 
        was not a police officer or a lawyer among them. The domestic economy 
        of the island was simplicity itself. The fashions of Paris did not affect 
        the inhabitants; each dressed according to his taste. Although there was 
        no doctor, the people were all healthy, and the children' were all beautiful. 
        There were about forty-five souls on the island all told. The adults were 
        mostly from the mainland of South America. One lady there, from Chile, 
        who made a flying-jib for the Spray, taking her pay in tallow, would be 
        called a belle at Newport. Blessed island of Juan Fernandez! Why Alexander 
        Selkirk ever left you was more than I could make out. A large ship which 
        had arrived some time before, on fire, had been stranded at the head of 
        the bay, and as the sea smashed her to pieces on the rocks, after the 
        fire was drowned, the islanders picked up the timbers and utilized them 
        in the construction of houses, which naturally presented a ship-like appearance. 
        The house of the king of Juan Fernandez, Manuel Carroza by name, besides 
        resembling the ark, wore a polished brass knocker on its only door, which 
        was painted green. In front of this gorgeous entrance was a flag-mast 
        all ataunto, and near it a smart whale-boat painted red and blue, the 
        delight of the king's old age. I of course made a pilgrimage to the old 
        lookout place at the top of the mountain, where Selkirk spent many days 
        peering into the distance for the ship which came at last. From a tablet 
        fixed into the face of the rock I copied these words, inscribed in Arabic 
        capitals: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" color="#660000">IN 
        MEMORY OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK, MARINER, A native of Largo, in the County 
        of Fife, Scotland, who lived on this island in complete solitude for four 
        years and four months. He was landed from the Cinque Ports galley, 96 
        tons, 18 guns, A.D. 1704, and was taken off in the Duke, privateer, 12th 
        February, 1709. He died Lieutenant of H.M.S. Weymouth, A.D. I723,1 aged 
        47. This tablet is erected near Selkirk's lookout, by Commodore Powell 
        and the officers of H.M.S. Topaze, A.D. 1868.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">Mr. J. Cuthbert 
        Hadden, in the "Century Magazine" for July, 1899 shows that the tablet 
        is in error as to the year of Selkirk's death. It should be 1721. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">The cave 
        in which Selkirk dwelt while on the island is at the head of the bay now 
        called Robinson Crusoe Bay. It is around a bold headland west of the present 
        anchorage and landing. Ships have anchored there, but it affords a very 
        indifferent berth. Both of these anchorages are exposed to north winds, 
        which, however, do not reach home with much violence. The holding-ground 
        being good in the first-named bay to the eastward, the anchorage there 
        may be considered safe, although the undertow at times makes it wild riding. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">I visited 
        Robinson Crusoe Bay in a boat, and with some difficulty landed through 
        the surf near the cave, which I entered. I found it dry and inhabitable. 
        It is located in a beautiful nook sheltered by high mountains from all 
        the severe storms that sweep over the island, which are not many; for 
        it lies near the limits of the trade-wind regions, being in latitude 35*¼ 
        S. The island is about fourteen miles in length, east and west, and eight 
        miles in width; its height is over three thousand feet. Its distance from 
        Chile, to which country it belongs, is about three hundred and forty miles. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">Juan Fernandez 
        was once a convict station. A number of caves in which the prisoners were 
        kept, damp, unwholesome dens, are no longer in use, and no more prisoners 
        are sent to the island. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">The pleasantest 
        day I spent on the island, if not the pleasantest on my whole voyage, 
        was my last day on shore, but by no means because it was the last, when 
        the children of the little community, one and all, went out with me to 
        gather wild fruits for the voyage. We found quinces, peaches, and figs, 
        and the children gathered a basket of each. It takes very little to please 
        children, and these little ones, never hearing a word in their lives except 
        Spanish, made the hills ring with mirth at the sounds of words in English. 
        They asked me the names of all manner of things on the island. We came 
        to a wild fig-tree loaded with fruit, of which I gave them the English 
        name. "Figgies, figgies!" they cried, while they picked till their baskets 
        were full. But when I told them that the cabra they pointed out was only 
        a goat, they screamed with laughter, and rolled on the grass in wild delight 
        to think that a man had come to their island who would call a cabra a 
        goat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">The first 
        child born on Juan Fernandez, I was told, had become a beautiful woman 
        and was now a mother. Manuel Carroza and the good soul who followed him 
        here from Brazil had laid away their only child, a girl, at the age of 
        seven, in the little churchyard on the point. In the same half-acre were 
        other mounds among the rough lava rocks, some marking the burial-place 
        of native-born children, some the resting places of seamen from passing 
        ships, landed here to end days of sickness and get into a sailors' heaven. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">The greatest 
        drawback I saw in the island was the want of a school. A class there would 
        necessarily be small, but to some kind soul who loved teaching and quietude, 
        life on Juan Fernandez would, for a limited time, be one of delight. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">On the morning 
        of May 5, 1896, I sailed from Juan Fernandez, having feasted on many things 
        but on nothing sweeter than the adventure itself of a visit to the home 
        and to the very cave of Robinson Crusoe.</font></p>
