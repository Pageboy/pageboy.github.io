      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Island of <b>Juan 
        Fernandez</b><font size="-1"> was visited by Captain Woodes Rogers in 
        1709 during his voyage around the world in the two ships <i>Duke</i> and 
        <i>Duchess</i>. This is his account of <font color="#660000">Alexander 
        Selkirk</font> who he found there:<font size="-2"> </font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">"He had 
        with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets 
        and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, some practical pieces, 
        and his mathematical instruments and books. He diverted and provided for 
        himself as well as he could, but for the first eight months had to bear 
        up against melancholy, and the terror of being left alone in such a desolate 
        place. He built two huts with pimento trees, covered them with long grass, 
        and lined them with the skins of goats, which he killed with his own gun 
        as he wanted, so long as the powder lasted, which was but a pound; and 
        that being almost spent he got fire by rubbing two sticks of pimento wood 
        together upon his knee..........." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">"After he 
        had conquered his melancholy, he diverted himself sometimes with cutting 
        his name on trees, and of the time of his being left, and continuance 
        there. He was at first much pestered with cats and rats that bred in great 
        numbers from some of each species which had got ashore from ships that 
        put in there for wood and water. The rats gnawed his feet and clothes 
        whilst asleep, which obliged him to cherish the cats with his goats' flesh, 
        by which so many of them became so tame, that they would lie about in 
        hundreds, and soon delivered him from the rats. He likewise tamed some 
        kids; to divert himself, would now and then sing and dance with them and 
        his cats; so that by the favor of providence, and the vigor of his youth, 
        being now but thirty years old, he came, at last, to conquer all the inconveniences 
        of his solitude, and to be very easy." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">"When his 
        clothes were worn out he made himself a coat and a cap of goat skins, 
        which he stitched together with little thongs of the same, that he cut 
        with his knife. He had no other needle but a nail; and when his knife 
        was worn to the back he made others, as well as he could, of some iron 
        hoops that were left ashore, which he beat thin and ground upon stones. 
        Having some linen cloth by him, he sewed him some shirts with a nail and, 
        stitched them with the worsted of his old stockings, which he pulled out 
        on purpose. He had his last shirt on when we found him on the island."
