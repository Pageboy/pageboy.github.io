</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The word, which I interpret 
the Flying or Floating Island, is in the original Laputa, whereof I could never 
learn the true etymology. Lap in the old obsolete language signifies high, and 
untuh, a governor, from which they say by corruption was derived Laputa, from 
Lapuntuh. But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little 
strained. I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of my own, 
that Laputa was quasi lap outed; lap signifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams 
in the sea, and outed, a wing, which however I shall not obtrude, but submit to 
the judicious reader.</font>
