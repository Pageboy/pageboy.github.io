We have become very familiar with these strange looking graphic squares; visible on products and posters. We (most of us anyway) know that if we point our smartphone cameras at these 2 dimensional codes, we can then be led to a web site for further information.

So, while we have a physical work of art, hanging on the wall, other details can be provided. This may simply be a caption or, in my case I like to include a short narrative about the work. Indeed very short — just a few words to signify the inspiration behind the piece.

You can see in the piece hanging on the wall above that on the side of the panel I have printed and mounted a QR code.
You can read about QR codes here: [QR Code story](https://www.qrcode.com/en/history/).

Here is a an example:

![QR Code leads to my website](../uploads/large-qr-code.png)

This QR code will lead to my web site for this piece and you can read:

> _The August rain has painted the garden with glossy colour. The fiery oranges and reds contrast with the blades of green that shun the water. The_ Crocosmia _plants that are native to Africa deserve a closer look and the camera penetrates the stems and capsules to find forking curves and droplets of water._

As well as this we ca also see another image of the work and further details about the dimensions.

## What are the advantages of this approach?

Apart from expanding the information available for this work it also means that the web page (for this work) can be updated with news about its provenance, sale and exhibition. So, if you own this work or see it an exhibition, a digital reference is available at anytime.

### How can QR codes be created?

There are several websites that offer this service but I use [QRCodeMonkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)

## Beyond the Link

If you want to pay for QR code services then it is also possible to track the number of links from the code. Many services offer this functionality, but I am not using it like this. My objective is to simply provide some text that relates to the making of the piece.
