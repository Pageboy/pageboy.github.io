As you may notice from my [artworks](https://www.chrisjennings.net), I am inspired to use various forms of arc in my work.

The geometry of the arc has many variations in bridges and architectural details, such as windows and doors.

I am fortunate enough to live in the beautiful city of Oxford and I can't help but notice the shapes that are present in much of the brickwork around our streets.

Here are some further examples.

We often see more basic forms that _do the job_ of supporting the wall above the opening, and here we have two examples that lack a certain refinemnt, but are never the less, attractive.

## Did I mention bridges?

There are many bridges in [my collection here](https://www.chrisjennings.net/photographs/bridges-on-the-thames/), but I pick this one of the Osney Road Bridge over the Thames which has a very low arch and is, in fact the lowest bridge on the Thames, preventing larger vessels from navigating upstream of Oxford.

If you follow the link to my web site you can see below, how I am building a _catalogue_ of images of arcs which I keep in my Flickr album. Not all from Oxford, of course!
