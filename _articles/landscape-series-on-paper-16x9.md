## What lead me to these prints that are based on the 16x9 proportion in landscape format?

The wild meadow by the river. The sweeping mixtures of grass meeting the reeds at the waters’ edge. Dark shades mix in with the multitude of greens.

With this proportion the relationship between the length and height is not one half, so, in my construction of the geometry, I have added a single unit height rectangle at the bottom of each composition in an appropriate colour or image. This provides the ability to use vertical symmetry.

The content of this block of is carefully chosen and effectively _underlines_ the construction.

I started this series in Autumn 2021 in a digital form only, but soon paid a local service to print onto archival paper.

Bracken brown on the forest floor with last years leaves crunching on the walking ground. Slim tree bark parallel to my verticals with shifted hexagon aligned to transparent structure. New season green just seen through the past year.

This image was created from forest photographs with fallen leaves used in the bottom band.

## Captions

I always feel that some expression in text enhances the interest in these images so I soon considered ways to caption the images.

At first I used simple lines of text (like Haiku):

> _Forest Floor  
> Bracken Brown  
> Leaf Layer_

_This from the image above_, but then felt a short prose was more expressive.

**Please note**, that the Medium editor (where you are reading this), does not provide for multiple lines in the captions under the images.

## Printing My own

The local printing service was excellent, but it soon became apparent that I needed more control over the whole process. Time to spend some money on my own printer. Some reviews, budget and space constraints later, I then took delivery of a Canon Pro 1000.

Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000

This prints up to A2 size paper although rolls of paper can also be used.

### Paper

After much research and trials, I now print on Hahnemühle German Etching paper. This is a traditional mould-made copperplate printing paper, complete with an inkjet coating. This paper is acid free and has archival properties.

### Framing

The prints need to be framed with museum quality glass. Although this glass is expensive it avoids the reflection that detracts from the image quality and details.

### More on the Captions

The prints are not captioned however, a QR code is printed in the margin leading the viewer (via their phone camera) to the web page for the image where the details and caption can be found.

Tangled leaves show through the shapes and structures. Flowers of white and colour highlight the shadows. The shapes are asymmetric in the image with outlines and alignment.

I am using close-up photos of the mixed undergrowth along the river Thames in this image. These early images used the central triangle as part of the theme.

The sea shore pebbles and the lapping water. Capturing colours and textures for the curved form. Added structural elements; repositories for the image details and colours that are alluring in the moment.

The images used in this image come from the beaches around Cadaques in Spain.

In the forest some trees are harvested, piled safely and revealing their aged rings. We count the rings to estimate their age and notice that some rings are wide and others narrow. Nearby, a sapling oak is only just learning how to drop last year’s brown and brittle leaves curled by the recent frosts.

Many walks in my local Wytham Woods are used in this image. Although I hate to see trees felled, the tree rings revealed are fascinating and I always try to count the years!
