I can't handle it anymore! Too many locations to post and so I have decided to *bite the bullet* - *grasp the nettle* and post all blog items here to chrisjennings.net. It makes sense 'cos that's who I am, and even though I have several *irons in my fire*, I need to keep it all together. Yes, all - photos, artwork, archive, design work, teaching work, whatever. Maintaining all of these web sites has become *too much*.

## The details

OK, so I'll keep ~~[publisha.github.io](publisha.github.io)~~ (now changed to [www.publisha.org)](https://www.publisha.org) for the long form articles about eBook, InDesign and web work, but one off blog posts will be here. A dolly mixture of posts about HTML, My boat, travels, activities and so on.

### All these channels are too much for any human.

Isn't it even too much to deal with these channels - YouTube.Facebook.Flickr.Twitter - but let's keep those, but just have one web site (almost!).

### So here is the plan

pagetoscreen.net will be retired, so I won't link to it here. I have the domain **publisha.org**, so plan to move the github pages site to there ([done it now](https://www.publisha.org)). I will stop using that site as a blog and just do those kinds of posts here.

Should I republish some posts. Yes, probably, so things stay together (that's the idea). I ahve already moved a few posts here and edited them.

### Social media

I am sure that this a common conundrum: where do you post up your stuff - Medium, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Flickr or just your blog - or **all of them**. Here are some thoughts on this.

#### Concluding

So there it is. You will find everything through here: **chrisjennings.net** - my blog, my pubishing knowldge base (publisha.org) and my boat now at (chrisjennings.net/perspectief). You can find photos and some pages linked to my Flickr lists.

**Next job -** organising my YouTube channels.
