The canopy is stretched over stainless steel hoops which are then hinged at 2 points on the top deck. Because the canopy needs to come down and be detached at the main hinge point, it was felt essential to change from a slotted bolt fitting to a quick release pin.

### An Unfortunate occurrence

To make the quick release pin slide into the hole (perviously threaded), it was necessary to drill out the hole. All went well with the port side but when drilling the starboard side mounting, the drill broke and the tip flew off in a rage.

### Oh hell!

The tip of the drill hit one panel of the windscreen with such force that the safety glass shattered. This was an expensive mistake.

The glass was replaced in the frame by my local car windscreen repairers and all is now well.
